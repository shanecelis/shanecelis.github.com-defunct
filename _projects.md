### [Paid Unity Assets](http://seawisphunter.com/#products)

- [Minibuffer Console](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/input-management/minibuffer-console-72667) is a developer console for Unity that is very Emacs-y.

- [Creature Eye Shader](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/creature-eye-shader-96106) is a procedural eye shader.

- [Custom Pointer](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/input-management/custom-pointer-43318) allows any object to become a mouse pointer.

- [GraphCraft](http://u3d.as/content/seawisp-hunter-llc/graph-craft/b1o) is graph-based creature builder.

### Open Source Unity Libraries

- [Realtime Simulated Caustics](https://github.com/shanecelis/water-demo), a straight port of Evan Wallace's "Water Demo" to Unity.

- [PushForth](https://github.com/shanecelis/push-forth-dotnet) is a light-weight, strongly-typed, stack-based genetic programming language for .NET

- [PshSharp](https://github.com/shanecelis/PshSharp) is a C# implementation of the Push programming language, a stack-based language designed for genetic programming. (Superseded by PushForth.)

- [RolePlay.Attributes library](https://github.com/shanecelis/SeawispHunter.RolePlay.Attributes) allows one to create a graph of mutually modifiable values without going crazy. (Slay the Spire is a game that does this: modifiers modifying modifiers.)

- [KeySequences](https://github.com/shanecelis/KeySequences) a performant trie-based key sequence recognizer (also known as cheatcodes).

- [Unity Package Template](https://github.com/shanecelis/unity-package-template) creates Unity packages easily.

### Non Unity

- [Entropy and Information Calculations library](https://github.com/shanecelis/SeawispHunter.Maths).

- [Code-cite](https://github.com/shanecelis/code-cite) is a tool to cite code from various sources.

- [Emacsy](https://github.com/shanecelis/emacsy) an embeddable Emacs-like library for GNU Guile Scheme. Think: Emacs minus the text editor.
